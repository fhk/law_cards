A 30-day notice does not apply to fixed-term leases, as these types of leases impose an obligation upon landlords to comply with the lease for the entirety of the agreed term. However, this is subject to a few exceptions such as in cases where tenants have not paid rent or have consistently breached the terms of the agreement.\u00a0\nIt is important to distinguish a 30-day notice with an eviction. The landlord who provides for a 30 day notice is not evicting his tenant. Instead, the landlord may simply want to amend some terms of the lease, or wishes to terminate the lease- in which case this must be made known to the tenant at least 30 days before the notice takes effect.\u00a0\nThe rules on 30-day notices vary from state to state, with some states having adopted a much lesser notice requirement.\nFor Month-to-Month leases:\nSome States that require Landlords to provide for a 30-Day notice include:\u00a0\n\nArizona (Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 33-1342, 33-1375)\nArkansas (Ark. Code Ann. \u00a7 18-17-704)\nIllinois (735 Ill. Comp. Stat. \u00a7 5/9-207)\nKansas (Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 58-2556, 58-2570)\n\nOther States, that require Landlords to provide more than a 30-day notice include:\u00a0\n\nDelaware ( Del.Code Ann. tit. 25, \u00a7\u00a7 5106, 5107): 60 days\nHawaii (Haw. Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 521-71, 521-21(d)): 45 days\n\nOther States that permit Landlords to provide less than a 30-day notice -\u00a0depending on the length of tenancy:\u00a0\n\nFlorida (Fla. Stat. \u00a7 83.57)\nLouisiana (La. Civ. Code art. 2728)\u00a0\nNorth Carolina (N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 42-14)\n\n[Last updated in February of 2022 by the Wex Definitions Team]\n"

Also referred to as the creditors meeting, its name comes from section 341 of the Bankruptcy Code. The purpose of a 341 meeting is to examine the debtor\u2019s financial position and to confirm the facts stated by the debtor in the bankruptcy filing. Therefore, the debtor must attend the 341 meeting, and answer the questions made by the presiding officer under penalty of perjury. In Chapter 7, 12, and 13 cases, the bankruptcy trustee assigned to the case presides the meeting. In Chapter 11 cases, a representative of the United States Trustee conducts the meeting.\nThe 341 meeting also aims to help the debtor understand the bankruptcy proceeding and allows creditors and other interested parties to make questions about the debtor\u2019s financial affairs. However, creditors are not required to attend the 341 meeting. Generally, the 341 meeting is scheduled between 20 days and 60 days after the debtor files for bankruptcy.\nAlthough the bankruptcy trustee may ask discretionary questions related to the matters of the bankruptcy case, among others, the trustee will ask at least the following standard questions to the debtor:\n\nIf the address on the petition is the current debtor\u2019s address.\nIf the debtor was the person who signed the petition, schedules, statements, and related documents of the bankruptcy filing.\nIf the debtor read the petition, schedules, statements, and related documents of the bankruptcy filing before signing them.\nIf the debtor is familiar with the information contained in the petition, schedules, statements, and related documents of the bankruptcy filing.\nIf, to the best of the debtor\u2019s knowledge, the information contained in the petition, schedules, statements, and related documents of the bankruptcy filing is true and correct.\nIf the debtor identified all its assets and listed all its creditors in the bankruptcy filing documents.\nIf the debtor had previously filed for bankruptcy.\n\n[Last updated in November of 2021 by the Wex Definitions Team]\n"

Specifically, it is a letter sent by the IRS to an individual that has been audited and found to have either (1) failed to submit their tax return or (2) submitted a deficient tax return. In either case, the IRS independently recalculates the individual\u2019s tax, penalties, and interest on their tax using wages and income reported to the IRS by the individual\u2019s employers, financial institutions, and other sources of income. The IRS then sends its assessed tax penalty within a 30 day letter (Letter 525), which allows the individual to accept or appeal the changes made to their return within 30 days, before the IRS processes the changes and sends a bill for the balance due in the 90 day letter.\u00a0\u00a0The 90 day letter generally explains the IRS\u2019s calculation of the individual\u2019s tax liability and the taxpayer\u2019s options. Taxpayers who wish to contest the tax penalty in their 90 day letter may either pay the assessed tax and file a request for a refund (or sue, if their request is denied) in District Court, or they may challenge the assessed tax immediately, without paying the tax, by filing a petition for review with the United States Tax Court within 90 days from the date of the notice (or 150 days, if they are located outside of the U.S). Failure to exercise either option within the allotted time is counted as a forfeiture of the right to contest the IRS\u2019s assessment.90 day letters serve as the government\u2019s final determination of one\u2019s tax liability in effort to assess and collect tax, as allowed under \u00a7 6212(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.
